# Story 7.5: Dark Mode Appearance

Status: done

<!-- Note: Validation is REQUIRED. Every story must complete all 4 steps: Create → Validate → Dev → Code Review. -->

## Story

As a **user**,
I want to switch between light and dark appearance modes,
so that I can use the application comfortably in any lighting condition.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. **Given** I am on any page of the application, **when** I toggle the appearance mode, **then** the UI switches between light and dark themes (FR41) **and** the preference persists across sessions

2. **Given** I have not set a preference, **when** I first visit the application, **then** the system detects my OS preference via `prefers-color-scheme` and applies it automatically **and** `next-themes` is used as the dark mode foundation

3. **Given** dark mode is active, **when** I inspect the design tokens, **then** all colors use oklch color space tokens defined via `@theme` directive in `globals.css` **and** the Trust Blue design direction and Warm Advisory accent adapt to dark mode appropriately

4. **Given** dark mode is active, **when** accessibility is evaluated, **then** color contrast meets WCAG AA standards **and** color is not the sole means of conveying information (icons/labels accompany status colors) (NFR26)

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [x] Task 1: Install `next-themes` and create ThemeProvider (AC: #2)
  - [x] Add `next-themes` to `apps/web/package.json`
  - [x] Create `apps/web/components/ThemeProvider.tsx` — client component wrapping `next-themes` `ThemeProvider`
  - [x] Update `apps/web/app/layout.tsx` — wrap `<body>` children with `<ThemeProvider attribute="class" defaultTheme="system" enableSystem>`
  - [x] Add `suppressHydrationWarning` to `<html>` tag (required by next-themes to avoid React hydration mismatch from injected script)

- [x] Task 2: Switch dark mode from `@media` to class-based (AC: #1, #2, #3)
  - [x] Replace `@media (prefers-color-scheme: dark) { @theme { ... } }` block in `globals.css` with a plain `.dark { ... }` block that sets CSS custom properties directly — **DO NOT nest `@theme` inside `.dark`**. The `@theme` directive is a top-level Tailwind v4 registration directive, not a nestable block. The light-mode `@theme` block registers the token names; the `.dark` block overrides their values via plain CSS custom properties (e.g., `--color-background: oklch(0.145 0 0);`)
  - [x] `next-themes` with `attribute="class"` adds/removes `dark` class on `<html>` — Tailwind v4 auto-detects the `.dark` selector and enables the `dark:` variant
  - [x] Keep the same dark palette values — they're already well-calibrated
  - [x] Note: The implemented token values in `globals.css` diverge slightly from the UX spec (e.g., `--color-background` is `oklch(1 0 0)` not the spec's `oklch(0.98 0.005 250)`). The implemented values are correct — do NOT "fix" them to match the spec

- [x] Task 3: Create theme toggle component (AC: #1)
  - [x] Create `apps/web/components/common/ThemeToggle.tsx` — client component
  - [x] Use `useTheme()` hook from `next-themes` for state + `setTheme()`
  - [x] Implement as a **cycling button** (single click cycles through states) — no dropdown menu needed (DropdownMenu is not installed in shadcn)
  - [x] Cycle order: light → dark → system → light (avoids the "first click does nothing" problem when OS is already light and cycle starts at system)
  - [x] Display current state with Lucide React icons: `Sun` (light), `Moon` (dark), `Monitor` (system)
  - [x] Style as shadcn `ghost` variant button (tertiary tier per button hierarchy)
  - [x] Place in `SidebarNav` component — after `</nav>`, pinned to bottom with `mt-auto` in the flex container. Since mobile overlay sidebar renders the same `SidebarNav`, toggle appears in both desktop and mobile automatically
  - [x] Handle SSR: render placeholder on server, resolve on mount (next-themes handles this — use `mounted` check pattern)

- [x] Task 4: Verify dark mode across all existing pages (AC: #3, #4)
  - [x] Dashboard page — charts, AI summary card, filter bar, demo mode banner
  - [x] Upload page — dropzone, progress indicators
  - [x] Billing page — subscription card, upgrade CTA
  - [x] Admin pages — tables, health indicators, analytics events
  - [x] Share page (public) — shared insight card
  - [x] Verify AI summary card left-border accent (`--color-accent-warm`) adapts appropriately
  - [x] Recharts chart components already use CSS token classes (`stroke-primary`, `fill-accent-warm`, `fill-muted`, `bg-card`, `text-card-foreground`) — verified, no chart code changes needed. Just confirm visually.

- [x] Task 5: WCAG AA contrast verification (AC: #4)
  - [x] Verify all text/background combos meet 4.5:1 ratio in dark mode
  - [x] Verify interactive elements meet 3:1 ratio against adjacent colors
  - [x] Verify focus rings (`--color-ring`) are visible on dark backgrounds
  - [x] Verify status indicators still use icons + text labels alongside color (NFR26)
  - [x] Manual spot-check key pages with browser DevTools contrast checker

- [x] Task 6: Update ResponsiveToaster for dark mode (AC: #3)
  - [x] Sonner does NOT auto-detect the `dark` class — update `apps/web/components/common/ResponsiveToaster.tsx` to consume `useTheme()` from `next-themes` and pass `theme={resolvedTheme}` to `<Toaster>`
  - [x] This requires making ResponsiveToaster a client component (add `'use client'` if not already present)
  - [x] Without this fix, toasts stay light-themed in dark mode

- [x] Task 7: Analytics event tracking (AC: #1)
  - [x] Track `theme.changed` event with `metadata: { theme: 'light' | 'dark' | 'system' }`
  - [x] Use `trackClientEvent()` from `apps/web/lib/analytics.ts` (NOT `api-client.ts`) — this is the existing fire-and-forget analytics function that POSTs to `/api/analytics`
  - [x] Fire on user toggle only (not on initial system detection)

- [x] Task 8: Tests (all ACs)
  - [x] Unit test ThemeToggle component — renders three states, calls `setTheme()` in correct cycle order
  - [x] Unit test ThemeProvider mounts without hydration errors
  - [x] Verify theme persistence by checking `next-themes` localStorage key

## Dev Notes

### What's Already In Place (95% foundation done)

The dark mode CSS infrastructure already exists. All color tokens are defined in oklch in `globals.css` with both light and dark values. The missing piece is the JavaScript runtime — `next-themes` + ThemeProvider + toggle button.

**Current state of `globals.css`:**
- Lines 3–37: Light mode oklch tokens via `@theme` directive
- Lines 74–96: Dark mode tokens via `@media (prefers-color-scheme: dark)` block
- All semantic colors (success, warning, destructive) already have dark variants
- Trust Blue primary: `oklch(0.55 0.15 250)` (light) / `oklch(0.65 0.15 250)` (dark)
- Warm Advisory accent: `oklch(0.7 0.15 60)` (light) / `oklch(0.75 0.12 60)` (dark)

**The main code change:** Replace `@media (prefers-color-scheme: dark) { @theme { ... } }` with a plain `.dark { ... }` block using CSS custom property overrides (NOT `@theme` — that's a top-level registration directive, not a nestable block). `next-themes` with `attribute="class"` manages the `dark` class on `<html>`, which Tailwind v4 picks up via its `dark:` variant. The system-preference detection still works — `next-themes` `enableSystem` reads `prefers-color-scheme` and applies the class accordingly.

**Token value note:** The implemented values in `globals.css` diverge slightly from the UX spec (e.g., `--color-background` is `oklch(1 0 0)`, not the spec's `oklch(0.98 0.005 250)`). The implemented values are correct and intentional — do NOT adjust them to match the spec.

### Architecture Compliance

The architecture doc defers dark mode to MVP-Complete tier: "CSS custom properties approach documented in decisions." The UX spec specifies `next-themes` as the provider and class-based dark mode via Tailwind v4's `dark:` variant. Direction 3 (Dark Focus) from the UX design directions becomes the dark palette — same hue family (blue/indigo 250) as Trust Blue for brand continuity.

### Current Root Layout

```typescript
// apps/web/app/layout.tsx — current state
export default function RootLayout({
  children,
}: Readonly<{
  children: React.ReactNode;
}>) {
  return (
    <html lang="en">
      <body className={`${inter.variable} font-sans antialiased`}>
        {children}
        <ResponsiveToaster />
      </body>
    </html>
  );
}
```

After this story: `<html>` gets `suppressHydrationWarning`, `<body>` children wrapped in `<ThemeProvider>`. The `ResponsiveToaster` goes inside the provider so toast styling picks up the theme.

### ThemeProvider Pattern (Client Component)

```typescript
// apps/web/components/ThemeProvider.tsx
'use client';

import { ThemeProvider as NextThemesProvider } from 'next-themes';
import type { ComponentProps } from 'react';

export function ThemeProvider({ children, ...props }: ComponentProps<typeof NextThemesProvider>) {
  return <NextThemesProvider {...props}>{children}</NextThemesProvider>;
}
```

This thin wrapper exists because `next-themes`'s `ThemeProvider` is a client component, but layout.tsx is a Server Component. The wrapper isolates the `'use client'` boundary.

### ThemeToggle Pattern

```typescript
// apps/web/components/common/ThemeToggle.tsx
'use client';

import { useTheme } from 'next-themes';
import { Sun, Moon, Monitor } from 'lucide-react';
import { useEffect, useState } from 'react';

// Must guard against SSR — useTheme returns undefined on server
// next-themes docs: check `mounted` before rendering theme-dependent UI
```

Cycle order: light → dark → system → light. This avoids the "first click does nothing" problem — if the user's OS is light and the cycle started at system, the first toggle would resolve to light (no visible change). Starting from the resolved theme and cycling forward keeps every click meaningful. Use `ghost` variant button (shadcn tertiary tier). Lucide icons are already in the project. No dropdown menu needed — DropdownMenu is not installed in shadcn and a cycling button is simpler.

### Toggle Placement

The sidebar component is at `apps/web/components/layout/Sidebar.tsx`. The `SidebarNav` uses a flex column layout. Add ThemeToggle after the `</nav>` closing tag, pinned to the bottom with `mt-auto` in the flex container. Since the mobile overlay sidebar renders the same `SidebarNav` component, the toggle automatically appears in both desktop and mobile — no separate mobile placement needed.

### Recharts Theme Compatibility — Already Handled

Verified: chart components already use CSS token classes (`stroke-primary`, `fill-accent-warm`, `fill-muted`, `bg-card`, `text-card-foreground`). Custom tooltips (`ExpenseTooltip`, `RevenueTooltip`) use Tailwind classes like `bg-card`, `border-border`, `text-card-foreground` which auto-adapt. No chart code changes needed — just visually confirm charts look correct in dark mode.

### shadcn/ui Components — Already Theme-Ready

shadcn/ui components use CSS variables (`cssVariables: true` in `components.json`). They'll pick up dark mode tokens automatically through the CSS variable swap. No per-component changes needed for: Button, Card, Alert, Progress, Table, Sheet.

### `prefers-reduced-motion` Interaction

The project already respects `prefers-reduced-motion: reduce` (project context line 375). Do NOT add a global color transition (e.g., `transition: background-color 200ms`) to smooth theme switching. CSS custom property swaps are instant, and that's the right behavior — theme changes should feel like flipping a light switch, not a slow fade. The toggle button itself has no animation either.

### Toast Theming — Requires Explicit Fix

Sonner does NOT auto-detect the `dark` class from `next-themes`. `ResponsiveToaster` must be updated to:
1. Import `useTheme` from `next-themes`
2. Pass `theme={resolvedTheme}` to `<Toaster>`
3. Ensure `ResponsiveToaster` is a client component (`'use client'`)

Without this, toasts stay light-themed even when the rest of the UI is dark. The component is at `apps/web/components/common/ResponsiveToaster.tsx`.

### Project Structure Notes

| Pattern | Convention |
|---------|-----------|
| Client components | `'use client'` directive at top |
| Common components | `apps/web/components/common/` |
| Layout components | `apps/web/components/layout/` |
| UI components (shadcn) | `apps/web/components/ui/` |
| Naming | PascalCase: `ThemeToggle.tsx`, `ThemeProvider.tsx` |
| Icons | Lucide React (tree-shakeable, default with shadcn/ui) |
| Button hierarchy | ghost variant = tertiary tier (for ThemeToggle) |
| Breakpoints | Base = mobile, `md:` = first breakpoint (768px), NO `sm:` |

### DO NOT Reinvent

| What | Where | Why |
|------|-------|-----|
| Dark mode color tokens | `apps/web/app/globals.css` lines 74–96 | Already defined in oklch — just change selector from `@media` to `.dark` |
| Component styling | shadcn/ui CSS variables | Components auto-adapt via CSS custom properties |
| Icon library | Lucide React (already installed) | Sun, Moon, Monitor icons available |
| Analytics tracking | `trackClientEvent()` in `apps/web/lib/analytics.ts` | Fire-and-forget POST to `/api/analytics` — do NOT use `api-client.ts` |
| Mobile component pattern | `useIsMobile` hook in `apps/web/lib/hooks/` | If conditional rendering needed for toggle placement |
| Toast system | `ResponsiveToaster` in `components/common/` | Already positioned correctly per platform |

### Testing Requirements

**Unit tests** (Vitest + React Testing Library):
- `ThemeToggle.test.tsx` — renders, cycles through themes, calls `setTheme()`
- Mock `next-themes` `useTheme` hook in tests

**What NOT to test:**
- `next-themes` internals (localStorage persistence, system detection) — that's the library's responsibility
- Every page in dark mode — visual regression testing is out of scope for MVP

**Framework:** Vitest. Co-locate as `*.test.tsx` with the component.

### Gotchas From Previous Epics

- **Hydration mismatch:** `next-themes` injects a script before React hydrates to set the theme class. Without `suppressHydrationWarning` on `<html>`, React throws a hydration error. This is documented in next-themes README.
- **`useTheme` returns undefined on server:** Always guard with a `mounted` state check before rendering theme-dependent UI. Pattern: `const [mounted, setMounted] = useState(false); useEffect(() => setMounted(true), []);` — render placeholder until mounted.
- **Tailwind v4 dark mode:** With CSS-first config, Tailwind v4 auto-detects `dark:` variant from the presence of a `.dark` class selector in your CSS. No `darkMode: 'class'` config needed (that's Tailwind v3 syntax).
- **DropdownMenu is NOT installed in shadcn.** Use a cycling button for the theme toggle — simpler, no extra dependency. Card, Button, Table, Sheet, Alert, Progress are the installed components.
- **`sm:` breakpoint is NOT USED** — all responsive starts at `md:` (768px). Base classes = mobile.
- **Button hierarchy:** ThemeToggle is `ghost` variant (tertiary). Do NOT use `default` (primary) or `outline` (secondary).
- **Known: tinypool "Channel closed" crash** at test process exit — not a test failure, Node 22 cleanup issue. Ignore it.

### Files to Create

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `apps/web/components/ThemeProvider.tsx` | Client component wrapping `next-themes` ThemeProvider |
| `apps/web/components/common/ThemeToggle.tsx` | Cycling theme toggle button (light → dark → system) |
| `apps/web/components/common/ThemeToggle.test.tsx` | Unit tests for toggle |

Note: `_explained.md` companion docs are mandatory per CLAUDE.md for new/substantially modified files. Generate them for `ThemeProvider.tsx` and `ThemeToggle.tsx` after implementation.

### Files to Modify

| File | Change |
|------|--------|
| `apps/web/package.json` | Add `next-themes` dependency |
| `apps/web/app/layout.tsx` | Wrap children in ThemeProvider, add `suppressHydrationWarning` to `<html>` |
| `apps/web/app/globals.css` | Replace `@media (prefers-color-scheme: dark) { @theme { ... } }` with plain `.dark { ... }` CSS custom property overrides (NOT nested `@theme`) |
| `apps/web/components/layout/Sidebar.tsx` | Add ThemeToggle pinned to bottom of SidebarNav with `mt-auto` |
| `apps/web/components/common/ResponsiveToaster.tsx` | Add `useTheme()` + pass `theme={resolvedTheme}` to Sonner `<Toaster>` |
